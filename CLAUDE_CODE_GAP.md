# Gap Analysis: yoyo vs Claude Code

Last verified: Day 74 (2026-05-13)
Last updated: Day 24 (2026-03-24) — major refresh on Day 38, stats refresh on Day 50, Day 54, Day 59, Day 61, Day 63, Day 64, Day 67, Day 74

This document tracks the feature gap between yoyo and Claude Code, used to inform
development priorities when there are no community issues to address. It is a
**snapshot**, not a TODO list — the priority queue at the bottom names the real
remaining gaps, but task selection still happens through the normal planning loop.

## Legend
- ✅ **Implemented** — yoyo has this
- 🟡 **Partial** — yoyo has a basic version, Claude Code's is better
- ❌ **Missing** — yoyo doesn't have this yet

## Core Agent Loop

| Feature | yoyo | Claude Code | Notes |
|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| Streaming text output | ✅ | ✅ | True token-by-token streaming — mid-line tokens render immediately, line-start briefly buffers for fence/header detection (Day 17, fixed line-buffering bug); streaming flush improvements (Day 23) |
| Tool execution | ✅ | ✅ | bash (with per-command timeout), read_file, write_file, edit_file, search, list_files, rename_symbol, ask_user, todo |
| Multi-turn conversation | ✅ | ✅ | Both maintain conversation history |
| Thinking/reasoning display | ✅ | ✅ | yoyo shows thinking dimmed; --thinking flag controls budget |
| Error recovery / auto-retry | ✅ | ✅ | yoagent retries 3x with exponential backoff by default; tool-specific recovery hints escalate on repeated failures (Day 70) |
| Auto-continue | ✅ | ✅ | Automatic follow-up on incomplete responses — `looks_incomplete` heuristic detects unclosed code blocks, numbered steps, continuation phrases; up to 5 auto-continues (configurable via `max_auto_continues` in `.yoyo.toml`) (Day 73) |
| Subagent / task spawning | 🟡 | ✅ | `/spawn` runs tasks in separate context; yoagent's `SubAgentTool` exposes subagents as tools; `SharedState` key-value store for parent↔child data sharing (Day 58); no named-role persistent orchestration yet |
| Tool output streaming | ✅ | ✅ | `ToolExecutionUpdate` events handled and rendered live (line counts, partial tail); real-time per-line subprocess streaming via `on_progress` (Day 62) — stdout lines print as they arrive, stderr lines prefixed with `stderr:` |
| Background processes | ✅ | ✅ | `/bg` command (Day 45): launch, list, view output, kill background jobs with persistent tracker; Claude Code has similar with `/bashes` |

## Context Management

| Feature | yoyo | Claude Code | Notes |
|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| Proactive context compaction | ✅ | ✅ | Proactive at 70% + auto-compact at 80% context (Day 23, upgraded from auto-only) |
| Manual compaction | ✅ | ✅ | /compact command |
| Token usage display | ✅ | ✅ | /tokens with visual bar; live context-window percentage in prompt |

| Cost estimation | ✅ | ✅ | Per-request and session totals |
| Context window awareness | ✅ | ✅ | Per-model context limit tracked (no longer hardcoded to 200k — #195 fix) |
| Persistent cross-session memory | ✅ | ✅ | yoyo has `memory/` system with JSONL archives + synthesized active context (learnings, social); Codex Chronicle has similar persistent project memory. Different implementation, same capability (Day 67) |

## Permission System

| Feature | yoyo | Claude Code | Notes |
|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| Tool approval prompts | ✅ | ✅ | `--yes`/`-y` to auto-approve; interactive confirm for bash, write_file, and edit_file; "always" persists per-session (Day 15) |

## Developer Workflow

| Feature | yoyo | Claude Code | Notes |
|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| Run tests | ✅ | ✅ | `/test` auto-detects project type and runs tests (Day 12) |
| Auto-fix lint errors | ✅ | ✅ | `/lint` auto-detects and runs linter; `/fix` sends failures to AI (Day 9+12) |
| PR description generation | ✅ | ✅ | `/pr create [--draft]` generates AI-powered PR descriptions |
| Commit message generation | ✅ | ✅ | `/commit` with heuristic-based message generation from staged diff (Day 8) |

| Multi-file refactoring | ✅ | ✅ | `/refactor` umbrella command (rename, extract, move); `rename_symbol` agent tool for cross-project renames (Day 23) |
| Architect mode | ✅ | ✅ | `/architect` dual-model mode — cheap model plans, expensive model edits; inspired by Aider's architect mode (Day 59) |
| Iterative prompt loop | ✅ | ❌ | `/loop <N|until-pass> <prompt>` runs a prompt repeatedly, useful for iterative refinement (Day 59) |
| Plan workflow | ✅ | ❌ | `/plan` generates a structured plan, `/plan show` reviews it, `/plan apply` executes — full generate/review/execute workflow (Day 72) |
| Auto-lint-test per edit | ✅ | ✅ | `AutoCheckTool` wrapper runs the first watch phase (typically lint/check) after each write_file/edit_file and appends errors inline; uses existing `/watch set` mechanism (Day 68) |
| Automated PR review agent | 🟡 | ✅ | Cursor BugBot provides event-driven automated PR review; yoyo has `/review` but it's on-demand, not triggered automatically by PR events (Day 67) |

## Configuration

| Feature | yoyo | Claude Code | Notes |
|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| Config file | ✅ | ✅ | yoyo reads .yoyo.toml and ~/.config/yoyo/config.toml |
| Per-project settings | ✅ | ✅ | .yoyo.toml in project directory |
| MCP server support | ✅ | ✅ | `--mcp` flag + `[[mcp.servers]]` config blocks; `McpServerConfig` + `parse_mcp_servers_from_config` in `src/config.rs`; stdio transport, used in production |
| Multi-provider support | ✅ | ❌ | yoyo supports 25 providers via `--provider` (anthropic, openai, google, ollama, bedrock, z.ai, cerebras, etc.) — `KNOWN_PROVIDERS` in `src/providers.rs` |
| Skills system | ✅ | ✅ | yoyo loads skills via `--skills <dir>` (yoagent's `SkillSet`); `/skill install`, `/skill search`, `/skill create`, `/skill list/show/enable/disable` (Days 60-61) |
| OpenAPI tool support | ✅ | ❌ | `--openapi <spec>` loads OpenAPI specs and registers API tools (Day 9) |
| Config system_prompt/system_file | ✅ | ✅ | `system_prompt` and `system_file` keys in .yoyo.toml for persistent custom prompts (Day 23) |
| Prompt caching | ✅ | ✅ | Anthropic prompt caching enabled — system prompt and early conversation turns cached for ~90% cost reduction on repeated context; cache hit-rate visible in `/cost` (Day 71) |
| Skill install & discovery | 🟡 | ✅ | `/skill install <dir>` (local) + `/skill install gh:user/repo` (remote) + `/skill search <query>` (GitHub discovery) shipped Days 60-61; still missing signed bundles, curation/ratings, formal marketplace with reviews |

## Error Handling

| Feature | yoyo | Claude Code | Notes |
|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| API error display | ✅ | ✅ | Shows error messages |
| Network retry | ✅ | ✅ | yoagent handles 3 retries with exponential backoff by default |
| Rate limit handling | ✅ | ✅ | yoagent respects retry-after headers on 429s |
| Context overflow recovery | ✅ | ✅ | Auto-compacts conversation and retries on context overflow errors (Day 20) |
| Provider fallback | ✅ | ❌ | `--fallback` chains providers; auto-switches on hard errors (#205, Day 31) |
| Graceful degradation | 🟡 | ✅ | Retry logic, error handling, context overflow recovery, provider fallback; not yet full fallback on partial tool failures |
| Ctrl+C handling | ✅ | ✅ | Both handle interrupts |

## Deployment & Isolation

| Feature | yoyo | Claude Code | Notes |
|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| Cloud background agents | ❌ | ✅ | Cursor Cloud Agents run on cloud git worktrees while user works locally; different deployment model (cloud vs CLI) — yoyo is a local CLI tool by design (Day 67) |
| Event-driven triggers / webhooks | ❌ | ✅ | Cursor agents triggered by GitHub events (PR opened, issue filed, etc.); yoyo has cron-based evolution but no event-driven hooks for arbitrary repo events (Day 67) |
| Sandboxed execution | ❌ | ✅ | Codex uses Docker/VM-based tool isolation for safe execution; yoyo runs tools directly in the user's environment (Day 67) |

## Priority Queue (real remaining gaps)

After the Day 38 refresh, the gaps that are actually still gaps. Re-evaluated
on Day 74 — two core gaps remain, plus deployment-model gaps and one
skills sub-gap.

1. **Persistent named subagents with orchestration** (since Day ≤38) — yoyo now has
   `/spawn`, yoagent's `SubAgentTool`, AND `SharedState` for parent↔child data
   sharing (Day 58), but still no named-role persistent subagent system (e.g., a
   long-lived "reviewer" or "tester" subagent the orchestrator can delegate to
   repeatedly across turns). SharedState closes the data-sharing gap; the
   orchestration gap remains.
2. **Full graceful degradation on partial tool failures** (since Day ≤38) — provider fallback
   covers hard API errors, but there's no story for "this tool call failed,
   try a different tool that achieves the same effect."
3. ~~**Per-edit auto-lint-test** (Aider parity)~~ — ✅ Closed Day 68.
   `AutoCheckTool` wrapper runs the first watch phase after each write_file/edit_file.
4. **Skill marketplace curation** (since Day 61) — `/skill install` and `/skill search`
   shipped on Days 60-61, closing the install/discovery gap. Still missing vs
   Claude Code: signed skill bundles, curation/ratings system, formal marketplace
   with reviews. A real but lower-priority gap — the install mechanics work,
   the trust/quality layer doesn't exist yet.

### Competitive landscape shift (Day 74)

The gap is no longer just yoyo vs Claude Code. The field has widened, and the
nature of the gaps has shifted:

**The biggest remaining gaps are deployment-model, not feature-level.** Cloud
agents (Cursor Cloud Agents running on remote worktrees), event-driven triggers
(Cursor BugBot auto-reviewing PRs), and sandboxed execution (Codex Docker/VM
isolation) represent architectural choices that a CLI tool can't replicate
without fundamentally changing what it is. These are ❌ by design choice, not
by oversight.

**Feature parity is close.** MCP, hooks, skills, multi-provider support,
sub-agent dispatch, persistent memory, prompt caching, clipboard integration,
plan workflows — these are now table-stakes across
competitors. yoyo has all of them (✅), which means they're no longer
differentiators but keep-pace requirements.

**Competitor highlights (Day 74):**
- **Claude Code** has a formal plugin ecosystem with 12+ bundled plugins,
  a marketplace with discoverability and install commands, and exposes web
  search, web fetch, code execution, advisor, and memory tools as first-class
  API capabilities. yoyo now matches on install/discovery mechanics
  (`/skill install`, `/skill search`) but lacks the curation/trust layer.
- **Cursor** has Cloud Agents (background cloud worktrees), BugBot (automated
  PR review), and event-driven triggers — pushing toward always-on agent
  presence rather than on-demand invocation.
- **Codex CLI** (OpenAI) has npm/brew install, ChatGPT plan integration,
  sandboxed Docker execution, and a desktop app — lowering the barrier to
  entry for non-terminal users.
- **Aider** v0.85–0.86 added GPT-5 family, Grok-4, and o3-pro support,
  self-contribution metric (88% self-written), plus per-edit auto-lint-test —
  yoyo now matches auto-lint with `AutoCheckTool` (Day 68) and has its own
  self-written metric via `compute_self_written_pct` (Day 68).

yoyo's differentiators remain and have grown: open-source self-evolution,
multi-provider support (14 backends), the skills ecosystem (`/skill install`,
`/skill search`, `/skill create`, 13 skills), `/architect` dual-model mode
(Aider parity), `/loop` iterative refinement, `/plan` generate/review/execute
workflow, `SharedState` for sub-agent data sharing, persistent memory system
(`memory/` JSONL + active context), prompt caching, and the explore-codebase +
x-research + synthesis skills for RLM-style sub-agent dispatch. The plugin gap
has shifted from "no install/discovery at all" to "install works, curation
doesn't exist yet."

### Competitive Notes (Day 74)

The competitive landscape has matured. The key insight from Day 67 still holds:
**the biggest gaps are now deployment-model (cloud agents, IDE integration,
sandboxed execution) rather than feature-level.** Feature parity is close — yoyo
has MCP, hooks, skills, memory, multi-provider, sub-agents, prompt caching,
clipboard, plan workflows, and most developer workflow commands that competitors
offer. The remaining feature-level gaps (persistent named subagents) are
tractable engineering work.

The deployment-model gaps (cloud worktrees, event-driven triggers, Docker
isolation) represent a different class of challenge: they require
fundamentally rethinking what a CLI tool is. These aren't bugs to fix
or features to add — they're architectural decisions about where and how
the agent runs. yoyo's strength as a lightweight, local, open-source CLI
tool is precisely what makes these gaps hard to close, and possibly not
worth closing. A CLI tool that tries to be a cloud service is neither.

MCP and hooks are now table-stakes — all competitors have them. They're
no longer differentiators but ✅ means yoyo keeps pace.

### What was on the old priority queue and is now done

These were listed as gaps on Day 24 but have shipped since:

- ✅ **MCP server support** — `--mcp` flag, `[[mcp.servers]]` config blocks,
  `McpServerConfig` and `parse_mcp_servers_from_config` in `src/config.rs`,
  used in production for weeks.
- ✅ **User-configurable hooks** — `[[hooks]]` config blocks, `Hook` trait and
  `HookRegistry` in `src/hooks.rs`, closing Issue #21 (Day 34).
- ✅ **Sub-agent tool** — `build_sub_agent_tool` in `src/tools.rs` exposes
  yoagent's `SubAgentTool` to the model.
- ✅ **Per-model context window** — Issue #195 fix removed the hardcoded
  200k limit; `effective_context_tokens` in `src/cli.rs` reads per-model
  defaults.
- ✅ **Provider fallback** — `--fallback` chains providers and auto-switches
  on hard errors (Issue #205, Day 31, `try_switch_to_fallback` in `src/agent_builder.rs`).
- ✅ **Bedrock provider wiring** — both the wizard and the actual provider
  construction landed (Day 30 trap closed).
