# Changelog

All notable changes to **yoyo-agent** (`cargo install yoyo-agent`) are documented here.

This project is a self-evolving coding agent — every change was planned, implemented, and tested by yoyo itself during automated evolution sessions. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.10] — 2026-05-02

6 sessions spanning Days 61–63. Real-time bash streaming closes the #1 competitive gap, non-interactive code review enables CI pipeline integration, three new skills (synthesis, explore-codebase, x-research) expand the RLM substrate, and the skill ecosystem gains GitHub-based discovery and remote installation.

### Added

- **Real-time bash output streaming** — live stdout/stderr via yoagent's `on_progress` callback replaces buffered output; the single biggest UX gap vs Claude Code, now closed (Day 62)
- **Non-interactive `yoyo review`** — run code review from CLI without entering the REPL, with `--json` output and exit codes for CI pipeline integration (Day 63)
- **`/context files` subcommand** — see which files were touched during the current conversation (Day 62)
- **`/skill search` on GitHub** — discover community-published skills by searching GitHub repositories (Day 61)
- **`/skill install gh:user/repo`** — install skills directly from GitHub repositories (Day 61)
- **synthesis skill** — multi-source research comparison via sub-agent dispatch and SharedState; aggregates 3+ sources or any source >5KB (Day 62)
- **explore-codebase skill** — RLM-style large-codebase comprehension by dispatching sub-agents to explore regions without bloating main context (Day 61)
- **x-research skill** — read X/Twitter via xurl: search posts, fetch threads, read profiles, and read long-form articles (Day 61)

### Improved

- **Auto-retry with tool-specific recovery hints** — retry prompts now include the tool name and specific recovery suggestions (e.g. "check file exists" for read_file, "try a different search pattern" for search), improving agent self-recovery (Day 62)
- **Gap analysis updated** — competitive analysis refreshed to reflect skill ecosystem maturity and recent changes in Claude Code, Aider, and Codex (Day 61)

### Changed (Internal / Architecture)

- **4 module extractions** continuing the consolidation arc:
  - `dispatch_sub.rs` from `dispatch.rs` — CLI subcommand routing, `flag_value`, `FlagValueCheck` (Day 61)
  - `commands_todo.rs` from `commands_project.rs` — `/todo` handling (Day 61)
  - `commands_goal.rs` from `commands_project.rs` — `/goal` handling (Day 61)
  - `commands_ast_grep.rs` from `commands_search.rs` — `/ast` command (Day 63)

## [0.1.9] — 2026-04-29

18 sessions spanning Days 50–60. Dual-model architecture mode, iterative prompt loops, direct positional prompts, ten module extractions, zero production unwraps, SharedState for sub-agents, multi-phase watch, and a long consolidation arc that cleaned house before building new rooms.

### Added

- **`/architect` dual-model mode** — Aider-inspired split where a strong reasoner (e.g. Claude Opus) plans changes and a cheaper model executes them, cutting complex-task costs 60–80%; toggle with `/architect` or `/architect <model>` (Day 59)
- **`/loop` iterative prompt command** — repeat a prompt N times (`/loop 5 "fix warnings"`) or until a command passes (`/loop until-pass cargo test`), automating the fix-test-fix cycle (Day 59)
- **Bare positional prompts** — `yoyo "fix this bug"` now works without `--prompt`; leftover CLI arguments are collected as a prompt, matching Claude Code/Aider/Codex UX (Day 59)
- **`/quick` direct model query** — skip the full agent loop for simple questions; one-turn Q&A with no tool calls (Day 55)
- **`/plan` mode** — sustained read-only toggle that allows search, read, and analysis but blocks modifications and destructive commands (Day 56)
- **`/checkpoint` command** — name a moment in your editing session and jump back later; supports save, restore, list, diff, and delete (Day 53)
- **`/outline <file>` file-scoped view** — symbol outline for a single file instead of the whole project (Day 58)
- **`/config set` and `/config get`** — change and inspect settings mid-session without editing TOML files (Day 56)
- **`/context tokens` breakdown** — system prompt section analysis showing token count per section (personality, project context, skills, etc.) (Day 56)
- **`--quiet` flag** — suppress informational output (config loaded, context files, spinners) for piped/scripted use (Day 57)
- **`/profile` command** — unified session summary in a bordered box showing model, provider, duration, turns, tokens, estimated cost, and color-coded context usage (Day 51)
- **"Did you mean?" fuzzy suggestions** — mistyped slash commands now suggest the closest match using Levenshtein distance with length-adaptive thresholds and unique prefix matching (Day 50)
- **5 more shell subcommands** — `changelog`, `config`, `permissions`, `todo`, and `memories` wired for direct CLI invocation without starting a session (Day 50)
- **`/config edit` subcommand** — opens `.yoyo.toml` or `~/.config/yoyo/config.toml` in `$EDITOR` (Day 50)
- **Proactive context budget warnings** — automatic warnings after each agent turn when context window usage is high (Day 50)
- **`--budget` flag for `/extended`** — set a wall-clock time limit for long-running tasks (Day 53)
- **SharedState for sub-agents** — parent and child agents share a key-value store via `yoagent::SharedState`, enabling artifact passing by reference instead of by copy (Day 58)

### Improved

- **`/watch all` multi-phase mode** — auto-detects both linter and test suite for your project and chains them (e.g. `cargo clippy && cargo test`), stopping at first failure; inspired by Aider's auto-lint-fix loop (Days 57–58)
- **`DispatchContext` struct** — consolidated 20 function arguments into a single named struct for the command dispatch system (Day 58)
- **Build metadata in version output** — `yoyo version` now shows git hash, build date, and platform: `yoyo v0.1.9 (a529e52 2026-04-23) linux-x86_64`; `DAY_COUNT` baked in at compile time so release binaries show the evolution day (Days 54–55)
- **Argument hints for subcommands** — dim inline completions (e.g. `/diff [file] [--stat] [--cached]`) appear when typing subcommands (Day 54)
- **Custom commands visible in `/help`** — `.yoyo/commands/*.md` files now appear in their own help section, and `/help my-command` shows their content (Day 56)
- **RTK dependency check in `/doctor`** — self-diagnostic now reports whether Rust Token Killer is installed (Day 56)
- **`stderr_is_terminal()` gating** — spinners, progress bars, and animated output suppressed when stderr is not a terminal, preventing garbage in piped output (Day 57)
- **Smart `/add` truncation** — files over 500 lines auto-truncate to first 200 + last 100 lines with an omission marker; explicit line ranges bypass truncation (Day 56)
- **Zero production unwraps** — every `.unwrap()` across the entire codebase replaced with explicit error handling or recovery paths; completed across Days 51–55 (Day 55)
- **Poison-proof mutex/rwlock handling** — all `.lock().unwrap()` calls replaced with `lock_or_recover()` helper in `sync_util.rs` that recovers from poisoned mutexes instead of cascading panics; deduplicated from three files into one shared module (Days 52, 58)
- **Exit summary enriched** — session goodbye now includes elapsed time, token count, and estimated cost alongside file changes (Day 53)
- **`/diff --stat` flag** — compact one-line-per-file summary view for diffs (Day 53)
- **Tool output compression** — command-aware filtering collapses `Compiling`/`Downloading` sequences, npm/pip install noise, and consecutive blank lines into compact summaries (Day 50)
- **Live bash output expanded** — increased visible partial output lines from 3 to 6 during command execution, with hidden line count header (Day 51)
- **Analyze-trajectory improvements** — JSON contract for structured sub-agent diagnoses, token-aware chunking for large CI logs, and improved fingerprint clustering that strips timestamps/job names (Days 58–59)

### Changed (Internal / Architecture)

- **10 module extractions** across the consolidation arc:
  - `agent_builder.rs` from `main.rs` — agent construction, MCP collision detection, fallback retry logic (Day 58)
  - `watch.rs` from `prompt.rs` — watch mode, multi-phase auto-fix loop (Day 58)
  - `commands_run.rs` from `commands_dev.rs` — `/loop` and `/run` handlers (Day 59)
  - `safety.rs` from `tools.rs` — bash command safety analysis (Day 54)
  - `session.rs` from `prompt.rs` — session tracking types and change recording (Day 54)
  - `prompt_budget.rs` from `prompt.rs` — wall-clock budget and audit log helpers (Day 54)
  - `sync_util.rs` (new) — shared `lock_or_recover` for poisoned mutex recovery (Day 58)
  - `dispatch.rs` from `repl.rs` — slash command dispatch with `DispatchContext` (Day 55)
  - `help.rs` expansion — 500 lines of help text moved from `cli.rs` (Day 57)
  - `format/output.rs` and `format/diff.rs` from `format/mod.rs` — split 3,092-line file into focused modules (Day 53)
- **`main.rs` reduced from ~2,484 to ~861 lines** — setup, restore, and agent-building logic extracted (Days 57–58)
- **`prompt.rs` reduced from ~3,063 to ~2,174 lines** — watch, session, and budget code extracted (Days 54, 58)
- **yoagent upgraded to 0.8** — one-line version bump, no breaking changes (Day 58)
- **Consolidated watch-fix loop** — 55-line inline copy in `repl.rs` replaced with 9-line call to shared `run_watch_after_prompt` returning `WatchResult` struct (Day 60)
- **LazyLock regex compilation** — 25 regex patterns in `commands_map.rs` now compile once via `LazyLock` instead of per-call (Day 58)

### Fixed

- **UTF-8 safety in refactor commands** — 12 byte-indexing operations in `commands_refactor.rs` replaced with `is_char_boundary()` checks to prevent panics on multi-byte characters; 13 new tests with CJK/emoji strings (Day 53)
- **Home directory hang** — file listing now caps at 10,000 files and skips `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `venv`, and other common large directories when outside a git repo (Issue #333, Day 55)
- **Missing DAY_COUNT in release builds** — `DAY_COUNT` now baked in at compile time via `build.rs` so release binaries show the correct evolution day (Issue #331, Day 55)
- **Integration tests burning 2.5 min per CI run** — two tests tried to connect to non-existent ollama, timing out with retries; switched to `--print-system-prompt` for instant exit (Day 51)
- **CWD race condition in test suite** — eliminated all `set_current_dir` calls from `commands_config.rs` and `commands_session.rs` tests by extracting `_in(root)` variants that take explicit paths (Day 51)
- **Flaky `build_repo_map_with_regex_backend` test** — fixed CWD race with explicit directory handling (Day 51)

- **Missing transition separator** — added separator between thinking output and text response sections (Day 22)

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-20

Bug fix release addressing two community-reported issues.

### Fixed

- **Image support broken via `/add`** — images added with `/add photo.png` were base64-encoded but injected as plain text content blocks instead of proper image content blocks, so the model couldn't actually see them. Now `/add` detects image files (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) and sends them as real image blocks the model can interpret. Closes [#138](https://github.com/yologdev/yoyo-evolve/issues/138).
- **Streaming output appeared all at once** — three root causes fixed: (1) spinner stop had a race condition that could prevent the clear sequence from executing, now clears synchronously; (2) thinking tokens went to stdout causing interleaving with text, now routed to stderr; (3) no separator between thinking and text output, now inserts a newline on transition. Also reduced the line-start resolve threshold so common short first tokens flush immediately. Closes [#137](https://github.com/yologdev/yoyo-evolve/issues/137).

- `--max-tokens` — cap response length
- `--max-turns` — limit agent turns per prompt (useful for scripted runs)
- `--system` / `--system-file` — custom system prompts
- `--verbose/-v` — show full tool arguments and result previews
- `--output/-o` — pipe response to a file
- `--api-key` — pass API key directly instead of relying on environment
- `/config` — display all active settings

#### Permission System
- **Interactive tool approval** — confirm prompts for `bash`, `write_file`, and `edit_file` with content/diff preview
- **"Always" option** — persists per-session via `AtomicBool`, so you only approve once
- `--yes/-y` — auto-approve all tool executions
- `--allow` / `--deny` — glob-based allowlist/blocklist for tool patterns
- `--allow-dir` / `--deny-dir` — directory restrictions with canonicalized path checks preventing traversal
- `[permissions]` and `[directories]` config file sections
- Deny-overrides-allow policy

#### Extensibility
- **MCP server support** — `--mcp` connects to MCP servers via stdio transport
- **OpenAPI tool loading** — `--openapi <spec>` registers tools from OpenAPI specifications
- **Skills system** — `--skills <dir>` loads markdown skill files with YAML frontmatter

#### CLI Modes
- **Interactive REPL** — default mode with full feature set
- **Single-shot prompt** — `--prompt/-p "question"` for one-off queries
- **Piped/stdin mode** — reads from stdin when not a TTY, auto-disables colors
- **Color control** — `--no-color` flag, `NO_COLOR` env var, auto-detection for non-TTY

#### Other
- `--help` / `--version` / `/version` — CLI metadata
- `/help` — grouped command reference (Navigation, Git, Project, Session, Config)
- **Ctrl+C handling** — graceful interrupt
- **Unknown flag warnings** — instead of silent ignoring
- **Unambiguous prefix matching** for slash commands (with greedy-match fix)

### Architecture

The codebase evolved from a single 200-line `main.rs` to 12 focused modules (~17,400 lines):

| Module | Lines | Responsibility |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| `main.rs` | ~1,470 | Entry point, tool building, `AgentConfig`, model config |
| `cli.rs` | ~2,360 | CLI argument parsing, config file loading, conversation bookmarks |
| `commands.rs` | ~2,990 | Slash command dispatch and grouped `/help` |
| `commands_git.rs` | ~1,190 | Git commands: `/diff`, `/commit`, `/pr`, `/review`, `/changes` |
| `commands_project.rs` | ~1,950 | Project commands: `/health`, `/fix`, `/test`, `/lint`, `/init`, `/index` |
| `commands_session.rs` | ~465 | Session commands: `/save`, `/load`, `/compact`, `/tokens`, `/cost` |
| `docs.rs` | ~520 | `/docs` crate API lookup |
| `format.rs` | ~3,280 | Output formatting, ANSI colors, markdown rendering, syntax highlighting, cost tracking |
| `git.rs` | ~790 | Git operations: branch detection, diff handling, PR interactions |
| `memory.rs` | ~375 | Project memory system (`.yoyo/memory.json`) |
| `prompt.rs` | ~1,090 | System prompt construction, project context assembly |
| `repl.rs` | ~880 | REPL loop, input handling, tab completion |

### Testing

- **800 tests** (733 unit + 67 integration)
- Integration tests run the actual binary as a subprocess — dogfooding real invocations
- Coverage includes: CLI flag validation, command parsing, error quality, exit codes, output formatting, edge cases (1000-char model names, Unicode emoji in arguments), project type detection, fuzzy scoring, health checks, git operations, session management, markdown rendering, cost calculation, permission logic, and more
- Mutation testing infrastructure via `cargo-mutants` with threshold-based pass/fail

### Documentation

- **mdbook guide** at `docs/book/` covering installation, all CLI flags, every REPL command, multi-line input, models, system prompts, thinking, skills, sessions, context management, git integration, cost tracking, troubleshooting, and permissions
- Landing page at `docs/index.html`
- In-code `/help` with grouped categories

### Evolution Infrastructure

- **3-phase evolution pipeline** (`scripts/evolve.sh`): plan → implement → communicate
- **GitHub issue integration** — reads community issues, self-filed issues, and help-wanted labels
- **Journal** (`journals/JOURNAL.md`) — chronological log of every evolution session
- **Learnings** (`memory/learnings.jsonl`) — self-reflections archive (JSONL, append-only with timestamps and source attribution)
- **Skills** — structured markdown guides for self-assessment, evolution, communication, research, release, and social interaction
- **CI** — build, test, clippy (warnings as errors), fmt check on every push/PR
