# Context Management

Claude models have a finite context window (200,000 tokens). As your conversation grows, it fills up. yoyo helps you manage this.

## Checking context usage

Use `/tokens` to see how full your context window is:

```
/tokens
```

Output:
```
  Active context:
    messages:    24
    current:     85.2k / 200.0k tokens
    ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░ 43%

  Session totals (all API calls):
    input:       120.5k tokens
    output:      45.2k tokens
    cache read:  30.0k tokens
    cache write: 15.0k tokens
    est. cost:   $0.892
```

When the context window exceeds 75%, you'll see a warning:

```
    ⚠ Context is getting full. Consider /clear or /compact.
```

## Manual compaction

Use `/compact` to compress the conversation:

```
/compact
```

This summarizes older messages while preserving recent context. You'll see what survived:

```
  compacted: 24 → 8 messages, ~85.2k → ~32.1k tokens
  📋 Still in context: src/main.rs, src/tools.rs, auth refactor (2 files, 1 topic)
```

The context summary shows which files and topics are still present after compaction, so you can trust that important context wasn't lost.

## Auto-compaction

When the context window exceeds **80%** capacity, yoyo automatically compacts the conversation. You'll see:

```
  ⚡ auto-compacted: 30 → 10 messages, ~165.0k → ~62.0k tokens
```

This happens transparently after each prompt response. You don't need to do anything — yoyo handles it.

## Clearing the conversation

If you want to start completely fresh:

```
/clear
```

This removes all messages and resets the conversation. Unlike `/compact`, nothing is preserved.

## Tips

- For long sessions, use `/tokens` periodically to monitor usage
- If you notice the agent losing track of earlier context, try `/compact`
- Starting a new task? Use `/clear` to avoid confusing the agent with unrelated history

## Checkpoint-restart strategy

For automated pipelines (like CI scripts), compaction can be lossy. The `--context-strategy checkpoint` flag provides an alternative: when context usage exceeds 70%, yoyo stops the agent loop and exits with code **2**.

```bash
yoyo --context-strategy checkpoint -p "do some long task"
# Exit code 2 means "context was getting full — restart me"
```

The calling script can then restart yoyo with fresh context. This is useful for multi-phase pipelines where a structured restart produces better results than lossy compaction.

The default strategy is `compaction`, which uses auto-compaction as described above.
