"""Detect outstanding forward-looking commitments yoyo made on GitHub issues.

Each evolve.sh session, this script makes ONE batched call to Claude to
triage all open issues: which of yoyo's last-bot-comments are unfulfilled
commitments to act in a future session, and which have already been
satisfied by a recent git commit? Outstanding commitments are surfaced at
the top of the Phase A prompt so yoyo sees its broken promises before
choosing new work.

Uses urllib only — no third-party dependencies — because evolve.sh runs in
GitHub Actions where reaching for `pip install anthropic` would add another
step that can fail silently.

Usage (from evolve.sh):
    cat reply_issues.json | BOT_LOGIN=yoyo-evolve \\
        GIT_LOG_RECENT="$(git log ...)" \\
        python3 scripts/scan_commitments.py

Input on stdin: JSON array of issues with `{number, title, comments[]}`.
Output on stdout: zero or more `### Issue #N — title\n...\n---` blocks.

Exit codes:
  0 — ran cleanly (may have emitted zero blocks)
  2 — config or auth failure (missing key, missing BOT_LOGIN, 401/403/400);
       the bash wrapper surfaces this as a louder banner so a broken cron
       does not silently lose commitment visibility for hours.

Transient failures (429, 5xx, network, timeout) stay on the silent-fail-soft
path: warn to stderr, retry with backoff, then return empty. The session
continues without the commitment block.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a triage assistant for an autonomous coding agent named yoyo.

yoyo runs hourly on a GitHub repository. Each cycle it picks issues to work
on, comments on them, and ships code. Sometimes yoyo's comment is a
forward-looking commitment — "Picking this up next session", "I'll
implement this", "On it" — that promises future action.

You are given:
1. A list of open GitHub issues. Each issue's `last_bot_comment` is yoyo's
   most recent comment on that issue. Older comments may also be included
   for context.
2. The subjects and bodies of recent git commits (last 30 days).

For each issue, decide:

A) IS yoyo's last_bot_comment a forward-looking commitment to act in a
   future session? A commitment requires:
   - A clear statement of intent to do specific work, by yoyo, in a future
     session (not the current one).
   - NOT just acknowledging the issue, asking for clarification, reporting
     completed work, or general musing.

   Examples of commitments:
     "Picking this up next session."
     "I'll add the missing test in the next cycle."
     "Will implement the fix once the upstream lands."

   Examples that are NOT commitments:
     "Done — landed in commit abc123."
     "Thanks for reporting; closing as wontfix."
     "I'll be honest, this is tricky."  (rhetorical "I'll")
     "Looking into it now."  (current session, not future)
     "Could you clarify what you mean by X?"

B) IF it is a commitment, has it been fulfilled by any of the recent git
   commits? A commit fulfills a commitment when its subject or body shows
   the promised work has shipped — typically by referencing the issue
   number (`#N` or `issue N`) or by clearly describing the same change the
   commitment promised. Be conservative: prefer false (unfulfilled) when
   uncertain.

Return your judgment as structured JSON matching the provided schema. Only
include issues that are TRULY outstanding commitments — skip non-promises
and skip fulfilled ones."""
